Building an end-to-end TML (Transport Message Layer) solution involves several components and steps. 
The maadsdocker/seneca-iot-tml-kafka-amd64 Docker image provides a starting point for your solution, 
but you'll need to create additional 
components and scripts to fulfill your requirements


STEP 1. Python Scripts:
Create Python scripts to interact with the TML and perform any necessary data manipulation or processing. 
These scripts should communicate with Kafka and other components. 
We can create these scripts in a directory called python_scripts.

STEP 2. TML Preprocessing using TML Binaries:
using TML binaries, make sure we have the TML binaries available. we can include them in the Docker 
image or use them as a part of your preprocessing step in your Python scripts.

STEP 3. Kafka/Tmux/MySQL Components:
Set up the Kafka, Tmux, and MySQL components.

STEP 4. Deploy in Docker and Kubernetes:
We can deploy your solution using both Docker and Kubernetes. 
Create a Dockerfile for our custom Python scripts and TML preprocessing, and another Dockerfile for your custom Tmux image.

STEP 5. For deploying to Kubernetes, we will be needing to create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for each service, 
like Kafka, MySQL, your custom service, etc.
